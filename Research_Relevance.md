Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative tool in meteorology, offering innovative solutions to longstanding challenges in tropical cyclone (TC) prediction. ML models excel at analyzing vast and complex datasets, identifying patterns in atmospheric variables that influence TC movement. By incorporating historical storm tracks, environmental factors, and real-time observational data, ML enhances the accuracy of trajectory forecasts. These predictions are critical for issuing timely warnings and minimizing societal impacts. Predicting peak winds is vital for understanding storm intensity and potential damage. ML algorithms can assimilate satellite imagery, oceanic and atmospheric data, and outputs from dynamical models to refine wind intensity forecasts. This approach captures non-linear interactions often missed by traditional methods. ML complements physics-based models, reducing forecast errors, improving computational efficiency, and offering probabilistic predictions, which enhance decision-making.

In this study we use a combination of National Hurricane Centre (NHC) best track and  Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme (SHIPS) data to develop a ML model that predicts TC track and intensity 24 hrs ahead of the storm. We used a supervised learning technique to develop these models. According to previous studies the a regression technique is best suited for this problem, therefore we explored regression techniques.
